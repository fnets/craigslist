### Dependency
* Python packages `feedparser`, `lxml`, `chromium/selenium`
* `sqlite3`

### How to use

1. Run `sqlite3 search_result.db < craigslist.sql` to initialize a SQLite3 database
2. Run `python craigslist.py` to populate the database with Craig's List RSS feed item. The code also copy `search_result.db` into `search_result.csv`
    * Modify parameters in `main()` in `craigslist.py` to fine tune your search
    * Options include multiple search terms, locations, type of listings, min/max price, etc.

### To do
1. Write to .csv instead of sqlite3 database (DONE)
